# thewartburgletters
My project analyzes Luther's Wartburg letters with the help ofÂ Palladio, a data visualization tool developed by Stanford's Humanities + Design. I have marked each letter for its content, as well as the individuals or events Luther makes reference to. Palladio allows for the letters to be organized in a number of different ways, even allowing data points to be linked to outside information.
